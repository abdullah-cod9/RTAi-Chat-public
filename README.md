# RTAi Chat

**RTAi Chat** was my first full-stack project — and also my first failure. It’s a real-time AI chat app that allows users to add friends to the same chat and converse together *with* AI in real time. The idea was simple: collaborative conversations enhanced by AI.

I spent months learning, building, breaking, and rebuilding the platform. As a result, you’ll find a mix of well-written and poorly written code, along with a few unused components from my experiments.

Despite gaining some users after launching it as a SaaS, I couldn’t grow it successfully — mainly because I lacked marketing knowledge. Still, it was a valuable experience that taught me a lot about product development, deployment, and working with AI and real-time systems.
